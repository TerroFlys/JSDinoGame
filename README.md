#### Example of the offline chrome game

#### My progress:
After a while I had implemented jumping,
enemies that go towards the left and
a score counter!

At this point I implemented localstorage to save
your highscore and Images! (I scaled them bad because of the sizes)

I think this will be it for this project.
If I am in the mood I might change the game up
but for now I will mark this as completed!

#### TODO:
* [x] Create the basics of the site
* [x] Movable player
* [x] Enemy objects like a cactus
* [x] Create something that is playable
* [x] Add images (*sprites*) instead of blocks etc
* [x] Base game
* [x] Score counter
* [x] Keep high-score in local storage
* [x] Completed
* [x] Add loading back in
